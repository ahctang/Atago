As a jungler I find it so stupid that taxing cs from laners gets you higher mastery score than securing drake/harold
Like seriously why is CS such an important factor when determining junglers mastery score

If i secure solo drake or harold I'm actually hurting my chances of getting S because they only count as 1 cs but not objective. If i want S my best option as jungler is to tax my carries and not give them buffs while mostly ignoring neutral objectives.

This is so stupid. Why is "playing to get S" not the same as "playing to win." I feel like im actively hurting my teams chance of winning if i want to get an S as jungler

The Breakdown with Zirene: Setting up the Engage (MSI 2017 Finals)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3V3sGZaTkE

I've figured it out. The return of Graves' Cigar + This year's 'Championship Skin' theory.
Okay okay, stick with me here.


In 2014, Imagine Dragons performed at the World finals and we got a Championship Syvanna skin(y'know, that DRAGON champion). Could seem like a coincidence but in 2016 we get a similar trend where Zedd performs and we get the Championship ZED skin. 

(EDIT: According to /u/x0hmychristian, 
"In 2015, Nicki Taylor sang Worlds Collide. In 2014 she was the lead vocals for Kalista's intro song. 2015 was championship Kalista", sorry I missed this one but yeah, Riot's all about those themed Championship Skins + Performers.)

Now, after years of neglecting Graves's Cigar, Riot randomly decides to bring it back up, coincidence? I think not.

We are getting Championship Graves with a performance by The ChainSmokers. Quote me on this one folks.

Spreadsheet With Every Champion And Every Statistic
I made a spreadsheet that's an index of every champion in the game, along with their base and leveled stats (rounded to the in-game shown value).  
This also includes their class and subclass (as declared by Riot [here](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/taking-another-look-subclasses?utm_source=LeagueClient&amp;utm_medium=OverviewTier2Pos1)) and the names are hyperlinks to their wiki page.

What's the best/funniest insults you've ever heard in a game?
Hey fellow summoners, 

I know this is a topic that keeps coming up but it's always fun to hear some of the best roasts/insults in league haha.

One i love is when in loading screen a TF was taking too long to load and right as we entered the game the nidalee said : "Hey TF , the only card you better be pulling is a fucking credit card to buy something better than the fucking gerbil run toaster you have." 


What's the best you've ever heard ?

G2 League of Legends Team Staff Update

http://www.g2esports.com/g2-staff-duffman-lol-team-manager

I'm Bryce Blum, the original esports attorney. I built my career through this sub and now represent 7/10 NA LCS Teams. AMA!
I canâ€™t believe it, but itâ€™s been 2~ years since my last AMA on this sub. I donâ€™t have nearly as much time to post here as I used to, and I genuinely miss it. Iâ€™m prepared for an all-day affair here. As long as you all keep asking new questions, Iâ€™ll keep pumping out answers. For those who donâ€™t know me, Iâ€™ll include some background below.

---

**My Background**: I practiced law at one of the largest law firms in Seattle, wrote a white paper about LoL-esports and the law that [rose to the top of this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1x0c07/just_how_big_has_lol_become/), and spring-boarded that into a practice focused on esports law. In January, I founded the worldâ€™s first dedicated esports law firm, ESG Law (www.esglaw.com), where I exclusively represent esports-related clients. I work with about 25-30 esports teams, including 7 from the NA LCS (TSM, C9, TL, P1, IMT, DIG, and NV) and 1 from EU (Fnatic), major esports talent (including Monte, DoA, and Voyboy), and esports-focused businesses (most notably Unikrn, a leader in regulated esports betting, where I am outside general counsel). I donâ€™t represent any active pro players for conflicts reasons.

I have a second full-time job at Catalyst Sports &amp; Media, where I am an EVP and co-manage our esports advisory division with a former Rioter (Avi Bhuiyan). Catalyst serves as the bridge between traditional sports and esports, advising major sports teams and owners, brands, and investors on how to successfully enter and navigate the esports space. Itâ€™s a really fun job, and weâ€™re at the forefront of a lot of the mainstream interest regarding esports right now. In addition to consulting, weâ€™re building a few esports initiatives ourselves, the first of which launched yesterday â€“ itâ€™s a [training facility designed for esports](https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2017/05/23/new-athletic-training-facility-for-excelling-in-esports/#7a40de5f2248). CLG is actually boot camping there as we speak.

Iâ€™m also fairly active on [twitter](https://twitter.com/esportslaw?lang=en) and as a content creator surrounding legal and business issues facing the industry. Iâ€™ve written a wide array of op eds for ESPN, appeared on various esports talk shows including a couple episodes of [Thorinâ€™s Esports Salon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si-BPQwPoac), and recently went on [Outside the Lines](http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=18518940) to talk about skin betting. Here are a couple recent examples of pieces that are pertinent to LoL: 

- [It's time to recognize esports as individual entities](http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/19187756/opinion-recognize-esports-individual-entities)
- [Esports ecosystem will level up from sports investment](http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/17651762/esports-ecosystem-level-sports-investment)

People are so hypocrite towards players who play out of meta champions.
Im a main Volibear in D4. I know hes in a bad spot right now but I still win 60% of my games with him.

Funny thing is when we are losing my team say Volibear is such a trash and useless champion but when we win they say "omg Volibear is so op." 

Sometimes in champ select they will tell me to play another champion but it doesn't happen too often.

Honestly, I rather have a teammate who play a "weak" aka out of meta champion if hes great with him instead of being a meta slave.

Why isnt NA LCS moved to Chicago?
A common issue in NA LCS is that players dont like playing soloq because the ms is both uncomfortable to play with as well, the shift from 9 to 60 ms between competitive and soloq ruins important muscle memory, almost disincentivizing the spamming of soloq. This is a major issue for NA and seems simply enough to address. Its an online competition so its not like the location really matters, i get that the riot office is already in CA, but there is a fundamental flaw in the system as it is with players not being able to practice effectively. They dont need to move it overnight, but some plan to get it up by like summer 2018 or somthing would be nice.
